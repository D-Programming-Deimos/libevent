libevent D interface
--------------------

From the libevent website: "The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a
callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a
timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
signals or regular timeouts.

libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network
servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or
remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop."

Library version: 2.0.16

Status: Apart from the deprecated/compatibilty files, all headers have been
translated. The high-level API is not tested well.

License: libevent itself is distributed under a 3-clause (or "modified") BSD
license. These files are a derived work and do not impose any additional
restrictions.
